              After arriving upon Nightstone, which they later learned had been destroyed by a giant attack, abandoned by the villagers and then robbed by goblins, the adventurers fought their way through the green monsters clearing most of them out. They discovered Kella Darkhope a Zhentarim spy hiding in the tavern. Then reaching the keep they prepared for an incoming attack from the Zhentarim force. Now they find themselves trapped back in the keep by bandits, managing to trap the bandit leader Xolxin Allasander beneath a rock.

              The adventurers make their way to the Dripping Caves to rescue the villages. Upon leaving the town, they encounter a hoard of orca led by a Mogunar, the half orc tavern brawler of daggerford. With the help of the clumsy Felgolos, they managed to annihilate the hoard leaving only a few orcs including Mogunar alive. They made a new friend which went flying off towards the coast.
